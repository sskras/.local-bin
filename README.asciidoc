= A repo of personal executables residing in `~/.local/bin`

Hopefully most of them will be cross-platform, ie. shell scripts (as opposed to binaries).

=== Deployment

Supposed be deployed transparently via https://github.com/sskras/.files[**sskras/.files**] onboarding mechanics.

Manual steps could be as follows:
```sh
cd ~/.local/bin
git clone --bare https://github.com/sskras/.local-bin.git .git
GIT_WORK_TREE="." \
git checkout
```

If there is no conflict, you will get new files along the old files (if any).
